# Confusing Output from the AutoGrader
For the next assignment of this week you might come across an error-like output from the AutoGrader (the software that grades your assignment), but also pass your assignment. In that particular scenerio, you can ignore the output, pat yourself on the back and move on to Course 2!

The reason for getting that output is that the AutoGrader has an alloted time for each cell before it declares timeout. If there is any cell in the assignment notebook that takes longer it gives that error-like message. Fortunately, our test results for the assignment do not rely on any such cells, which is why you might see the error, but also get points for your work in the assignment.
