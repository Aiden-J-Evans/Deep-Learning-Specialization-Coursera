# Deep Learning Coursera Specialization
Special thanks to Andrew Ng and the rest of the Coursera team for creating a very accessible Deep Learning Specialization. 
This repository contains the unsolved versions of the programming assignments as well as the quizzes and exploratory labs provided.

## How to do the exercises
The exercises typically use Interactive Python Notebooks (ie: the `.ipynb` files). You can use tools such as [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/), [Deepnote](deepnote.com), [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/)

Please feel free to fork a copy of this repository over for your personal use. Feel free to create a GitHub issue if something is missing. Happy learning :)

## Important Note
Some of the lab exercises will contain data files that you need to work with. Due to frustrations with Git LFS and the billing structure, I have moved some of those larger files into a publicly accessible Google Drive link. Please carefully follow the README.md for each lab and download all the supplemental files/folders to the specified directory BEFORE starting the assignment
